# Workflow

Central orchestration for the spec-driven workflow. The first argument determines the action: `init`, `propose`, `apply`, or `finalize`.

**Input**: `specshift <action> [arguments]`

## Step 1: Identify Action

Parse the first argument to determine which action to run. Read the `actions` array from WORKFLOW.md frontmatter to determine valid actions. If WORKFLOW.md is missing, fall back to built-in actions: `init`, `propose`, `apply`, `finalize`.

If no action provided or unrecognized: list available actions from the array and ask the user to choose.

## Step 2: Load WORKFLOW.md

Read `.specshift/WORKFLOW.md`. Extract from YAML frontmatter:
- `templates_dir`, `pipeline`, `actions` (array of action names), `worktree`, `auto_approve`

Read from markdown body:
- `## Context` section — follow its instructions (typically: read CONSTITUTION.md)
- `## Action: <name>` sections — each contains `### Instruction` (procedural guidance for the action)

If WORKFLOW.md is missing and action is not `init`, tell the user to run the specshift skill with `init` first and stop.

## Step 3: Change Context Detection

**Skip for `init`** — init operates at project level, not change level.

For `propose`, `apply`, `finalize`:
1. Get current branch: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
2. **Proposal frontmatter lookup**: Scan `.specshift/changes/*/proposal.md` for a proposal whose YAML frontmatter `branch` field matches the current branch. If found, auto-select that change.
3. **Fallback — worktree convention**: If no matching proposal, check if inside a worktree (`git rev-parse --git-dir` contains `/worktrees/`), derive change name from branch, search for `.specshift/changes/*-<branch-name>/`.
4. If detected: announce "Detected change context: using change '<name>'"
5. If not detected and action is `apply` or `finalize`: list active changes and ask the user to select.
6. If not detected and action is `propose`: the user may be starting a new change — proceed to propose dispatch which handles workspace creation.

## Step 4: Load Action Context

1. Read the `## Action: <action>` section from WORKFLOW.md body for the `### Instruction`.
2. For built-in actions (propose, apply, finalize, init): read the compiled requirements file at `actions/<action>.md` (relative to this skill).
3. For custom actions: no compiled requirements — the instruction from WORKFLOW.md is self-contained.

## Step 5: Dispatch

### `propose` — Pipeline Traversal

1. Read all change artifacts (if change exists).
2. Execute the action using the `### Instruction` from WORKFLOW.md as your primary directive, bounded by the strict requirements extracted in `actions/propose.md`.
3. For each step in `pipeline` array: read Smart Template at `<templates_dir>/<id>.md`, check artifact status, generate if ready
4. **After each artifact**, commit and push:
   - Stage the change artifacts and specs
   - Commit with message `WIP: <change-name> — <artifact-id>`
   - Push to remote
   - On first push (no PR exists): Create a draft PR titled `<Change Name>` with body `WIP: <change-name>` using available GitHub tooling (gh CLI, MCP tools, or API)
   - Skip PR creation if no GitHub tooling is available. Continue on push failure.
5. Follow the checkpoint behavior, workspace creation, and pipeline gates defined in the requirements.
6. **Auto-dispatch to apply**: If `auto_approve` is `true` in WORKFLOW.md frontmatter and propose completed successfully (all pipeline artifacts generated, no BLOCKED preflight), automatically dispatch the next stage by running `specshift apply` using the same change context. Do NOT pause — proceed directly.

### `apply` — Implementation

1. Read all change artifacts (research, proposal, design, tasks, specs)
2. Execute the action using the `### Instruction` from WORKFLOW.md as your primary directive, bounded by the strict requirements extracted in `actions/apply.md`. Use the change directory and artifact paths for context.
3. Implement tasks, generate review.md, run the QA loop
4. **Auto-dispatch to finalize**: If `auto_approve` is `true` and review.md verdict is PASS (no CRITICAL, no WARNING), automatically dispatch the next stage by running `specshift finalize` using the same change context. Do NOT pause for user approval — proceed directly.

### `finalize` — Post-Approval

1. Read change artifacts for context (proposal, review.md)
2. Execute the action using the `### Instruction` from WORKFLOW.md bounded by the strict requirements in `actions/finalize.md`.

### `init` — Project Setup

1. If WORKFLOW.md missing: this IS the fresh install — proceed with default init behavior
2. Execute the action using the `### Instruction` from WORKFLOW.md bounded by the strict requirements in `actions/init.md`.

### Custom Action — Direct Execution

For any action not listed above (propose, apply, finalize, init):
1. Read all change artifacts for context (all files in change directory)
2. Read the `## Action: <name>` instruction from WORKFLOW.md
3. If the `## Action: <name>` section is missing: report the error and stop
4. Execute the instruction directly with change directory context
5. No spec requirements are loaded (custom actions are self-contained via their instruction)

## Guardrails

- Always read WORKFLOW.md before dispatching
- Change context detection runs ONCE, shared across all actions
- Implementation agents receive bounded context — NOT the full conversation history
- If WORKFLOW.md is missing and action is not `init`: stop and suggest running the specshift skill with `init`
- For `propose`: do NOT create artifacts yet if the user hasn't confirmed what they want to build
- For `apply`: delete review.md at start of implementation to prevent stale reviews
